# Simple Task List
A very small sample project that demonstrates usage of several Spring features:
* Spring Boot Application
* Spring MVC Controllers with Model and Thymeleaf views
* REST Controllers
* Spring Data JDBC and how to use JdbcTemplate inside a Dao
* Spring Data JPA and how to use the EntityManager
* Some trivial tests with JUnit and Mockito

It was created as an example to support Spring programming lessons.
